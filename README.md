## Features

- **High Performance**: Modern vector techniques integrated into a well-designed architecture. 
- **Elastic Scalability**: Seamlessly scale across multiple threads, which is optimized by C++20 coroutines.
- **Adaptive Flexibility**: Easy customization for quantization methods, metrics, and data types.
- **Ease of Use**: [Intuitive APIs](./pyalaya/README.md) in Python.


## Getting Started!

Get started with just one command!
```bash
pip install alayalite # install the python package.
```



Access your vectors using simple APIs.
```python
from alayalite import Client, Index
from alayalite.utils import calc_recall, calc_gt
import numpy as np

# Initialize the client and create an index. The client can manage multiple indices with distinct names.
client = Client() 
index = client.create_index("default")

# Generate random vectors and queries, then calculate the ground truth top-10 nearest neighbors for each query.
vectors = np.random.rand(1000, 128).astype(np.float32)
queries = np.random.rand(10, 128).astype(np.float32)
gt = calc_gt(vectors, queries, 10)

# Insert vectors to the index
index.fit(vectors)

# Perform batch search for the queries and retrieve top-10 results
result = index.batch_search(queries, 10)

# Compute the recall based on the search results and ground truth
recall = calc_recall(result, gt)
print(recall)
```

## Benchmark

We evaluate the performance of AlayaLite against other vector database systems using [ANN-Benchmark](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks) (compile locally and open `-march=native` in your `CMakeLists.txt` to reproduce the results). Several experimental results are presented below.
